# We're hiring a Junior Developer

![](/assets/images/jobs.svg){: aria-hidden="true"}

**We’re looking to hire a junior developer** to join our team building open-source software for researchers. If you love the <small>AGPL</small> and know JavaScript, then come work with us on [Tropy](https://tropy.org/), a beautiful Electron app built with React, SQLite, and WebGL. We're not out to disrupt industries or moonshot anything; instead we build thoughtful, robust tools that scholars genuinely rely on all over the world. Think of Tropy as a portable archival reading room that transforms the researcher’s nightmare folder of <small>IMG_5261.JPG</small> files into organized, searchable, citable research material. To help us achieve this goal, you’ll work closely with our lead developer and product designer, who will encourage you to focus on the areas that interest you most, and help you to build new skills.
{: .lead}

## What you'll be doing
* Developing and maintaining features in our Javascript/Electron codebase
* Building integration components for AI transcription services: API orchestration, job queues, authentication workflows
* Writing documentation that future-you will actually appreciate
* Contributing to code reviews and helping keep the codebase maintainable

## You should probably apply if
* You're comfortable with JavaScript and know (or want to learn) Electron, React, or Node.js
* You understand Git workflows and aren't afraid of a mature codebase
* You can write clearly and communicate kindly with both developers and non-technical users
* You're genuinely interested in building tools that last

## Bonus points
* A background in research, digital humanities, archives, or cultural heritage work
* Familiarity with SQLite
* Knowledge of metadata standards (or a willingness to learn why they matter)
* An eye for accessibility and usability details

## About working with us
The Tropy team is based in Vienna, Rio de Janeiro, and Washington, D.C., though you’re invited to work remotely from wherever. We're part of [Digital Scholar](https://digitalscholar.org/), the parent organization of [Omeka](https://omeka.org/), [PressForward](https://pressforward.org/), [Sourcery](https://sourceryapp.org/), Tropy, and [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/), all open-source software projects serving millions of users.
We are a small, progressive team that likes to get things done without bureaucratic overhead. The team meets up in person from time to time, comparing notes on the local architecture and music scenes or finally sharing those pizza slices that fly around on Slack. Most of the time you’ll be working remotely, communicating with us on Slack and with Tropy users on our forums and on GitHub. Our workflow is collaborative yet asynchronous, apart from our weekly huddle, and you’ll do your own schedule.

## Logistics
This is an open-ended contract position with the possibility of full-time work, starting in early 2026. We're looking for someone who wants to grow with the project over years, building deep expertise in research software development.

**Location:** Remote<br>
**Start date:** 1 February 2026<br>
**Hourly rate:** 35 USD<br>
**Application deadline:** 15 January 2026<br>

## How to apply
Send us an email at [jobs@tropy.org](mailto:jobs@tropy.org?subject=Tropy%20Junior%20Developer) with:
1. A brief note about why you're interested
2. Your CV or résumé
3. Links to code samples, GitHub repos, or personal projects

We're especially curious about what draws you to research software and what you'd be excited to work on. Show us your quirks!
